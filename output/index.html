                  <p>Originally posted on <a href="http://digital-ducttape.com/2013/10/23/aws-vpc-buildout-with-foreman_hooks-for-rdns-creation/">Digital Ducttape</a></p>
                  
                  <p><a href="http://theforeman.org/">Foreman</a> is a tool I have used for a long time as an external node classifier for Puppet and its smart-proxy for integration with DNS. However when Foreman recently <a href="http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/1871">added support</a> for building EC2 instances inside a VPC, I thought it was a great opportunity to use the same tool for a new buildout.</p>
                  
                  <p>Shortly after starting I discovered that reverse DNS is <a href="http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/3166">unfortunately broken</a> for EC2 VPC builds. Foreman does not map a relationship between VPC subnets and any DNS smart-proxy. Unswayed I took to #foreman and was guided to a potential solution.
                  <!-- more --></p>
                  
                  <p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_hooks">foreman_hooks</a>. This plugin for foreman allows you to subscribe to create/update/destroy events and invoke any executable. Lucky for me this was a great workaround for the functionality lacking in the recent 1.3 release. Initially I wrote a script utilizing the smart-proxy API to create PTR records but it complained that the IP address was already assigned. Fair enough. Without further investigation I wrote instead a short shell script which does the same thing using nsupdate with tsigs and viola! Integrated forward and reverse DNS for EC2 VPC deployments. A few more lines of code added support for the destroy hook and now the feature is complete.</p>
                  
                  <p>I named this script rdns.sh and placed it in /usr/share/foreman/config/hooks.d and created symlinks to it in both:</p>
                  
                  <p>/usr/share/foreman/config/hooks/host/managed/destroy/<br />
                  /usr/share/foreman/config/hooks/host/managed/create/</p>
                  
                  <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/ddoc/8447483">source for rdns.sh</a><br />
                  <script src="https://gist.github.com/ddoc/8447483.js"></script>
                  <a href="https://gist.github.com/ddoc/8446722">source for utils.sh</a><br />
                  <a href="https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_hooks/blob/master/examples/hook_functions.sh">source for hook_functions.sh</a></p>
                  
                  <p>Of course, after implementing this I saw many uses for foreman_hooks including:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <li>resizing an EC2 root volume at build time</li>
                    <li>attaching additional volumes</li>
                    <li>EIP associations and DNS</li>
                    <li>different hooks for different domains</li>
                    <li>adding and removing hosts to an external monitoring system</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>I will post updates on these implementations at another time.</p>
